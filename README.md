# Wine-Prediction-Using-ML

Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Machine Learning Algorithms for Regression Analysis, Data Visualizations, and Data Analysis.
 
# Goal
 In this challenge, we used Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and KNN to predict wine quality. We showed our models' performance on the check data.
The learning result of this mission is to recognize the idea of some machine learning algorithms and implementation of them.
​
# Description of Dataset
The dataset we will be analyzing in this study is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository Wine Data:
The dataset includes data about pink and white vinho Verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal, with their 11 features: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol.
​
# Result
The random forest model has 73% accuracy on the check data, and it performs rather properly on the precise and low fine  wine, however, it sacrifices too much accuracy on the medium group. The SVM, which has 78% accuracy on the test data, is like a balanced model, it does not performs as well as Random Forest on the low and exact group, however, it improves their accuracy examine to SVM without resampling, and it does no longer lose to a great deal accuracy on the medium wine. Based on the commercial enterprise idea, the employer could use both model to classify their wine quality.
